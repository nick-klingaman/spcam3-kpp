# spcam3-kpp
Source code for the SPCAM3-KPP coupled model

This is the source code for the SPCAM3-KPP coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, which couples the Super Parameterized configuration of the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (SPCAM3) to the Many-Column configuration of the K Profile Parameterisation (MC-KPP) mixed-layer ocean model.  

The standard CAM3 was developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The original source code for that model can be found here: http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/docs/cam3.0/browser.html.  More recent versions of CAM can be obtained from NCAR, e.g., https://ncar.github.io/CAM/doc/build/html/index.html

The Super Parameterized configuration of CAM3 was developed principally by Marat Khairoutindov.  See details in https://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article/62/7/2136/26283.  More recent versions of SPCAM can be obtained from NCAR, e.g. https://ncar.github.io/CAM/doc/build/html/users_guide/atmospheric-configurations.html#super-parameterized-cam-spcam

MC-KPP was developed principally by Nick Klingaman, Steve Woolnough and Linda Hirons at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading.  Further details on MC-KPP, including the original source code, can be obtained from https://puma.nerc.ac.uk/trac/KPP_ocean.

This version of the SPCAM3-KPP source code was used to perform the simulations described in Gao et al. (2020): https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-63.  The simulations were performed on the ARCHER supercomputing facility: https://www.archer.ac.uk.

The source code is released without warranty of performance and without liability.  The code is not maintained.
